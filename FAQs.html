                <b><u>Enrolling in a Course:</u></b><br>
                <br>
                <b>
                    Q. How do I take or enroll in GuardU course?<br>
                </b><br>
                A. There are two ways you can enroll in a course: <b>self-enroll</b> and <b>instructor-enroll</b>.<br>
                <b>Self-enroll:</b> Most courses use the self-enrollment option. This allows you to enroll and take an available course at will. These courses are open to all.<br>
                <b>Instructor-enroll: </b>Other courses have restricted access and require the instructor to enroll the student in the course or to provide the student an enrollment key which he or she will use to enroll.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. How do I enroll in a self-enroll course?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Follow these instructions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start on the first page after the AKO/CAC login.&nbsp; Locate the Search box in the upper right hand corner of the screen.</li>
                <li>Type a word from the official course name into the search box</li>
                <li>Click the Search button</li>
                <li>This will return any course with the word in the name whether it is on GuardU or another site.</li>
                <li>
                    Click on the desired course link<br>
                    <strong>For Courses located on GuardU:</strong>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>A new page opens with the course information and an <em><strong>Enroll in Course</strong></em> button</li>
                <li>Click the Enroll button</li>
                <li>The page refreshes and the text "<strong><em>Successful Enrollment</em></strong>" and a <em><strong>Go To Course </strong></em>button are displayed.</li>
                <li>
                    Click the <em>Go To Course</em> button to enter the course.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>For Courses located outside of GuardU:</strong>
                </li>
                <li>A new page opens with the course information and a <strong><em>Go to Course</em></strong> button</li>
                <li>The site where the course is located opens - the user might be required to log into the site</li>
                <li>The user should navigate to where the course is located within the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Q. Where do I find a listing of courses offered through Guard</b><b>U?</b><br>
                <br>
                A1. There is a GuardU Catalog A-Z link on the Portal page that will give the user a complete list of GuardU courses.<br>
                A2. The Portal search will return a list of courses both on GuardU and other sites which match the criteria entered.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. Why can’t I find the course I am looking for?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. If you are using the search function, use key words for that course that appear in the course <strong><em>name.</em></strong> For example, using HAZMAT will return only the LTC-012 Hazardous Material Course.<br>
                <br>
                B. If you have already enrolled in a course, click on the <strong><em>My Guard Training</em></strong>&nbsp; link located on the Portal page.&nbsp; This will open the first page inside GuardU which is called the <em><strong>My GuardU</strong></em> tab page.&nbsp; Look in the center of this page for the section box labeled <em><strong>My Courses</strong></em>.&nbsp; You will find a link back to course inside of this box unless the time limit for the course has expired.<br>
                If you are having any issues finding the course, please contact your training manager, or you may open a trouble ticket by contacting the help desk.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b><u>General Information: </u></b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. The course I was taking is no longer available, why?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Many courses are presented for a limited time. If a student does not complete the course within that period of time, they are automatically removed.&nbsp; The student should re-enroll in the course.&nbsp; <br>
                Information about course duration can be found in the course instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q. Do my course completions transfer to DTMS?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Yes. All courses taken on GuardU will&nbsp; transfer to DTMS. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. Is there any system downtime I should be aware of?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Our scheduled downtime is from 1900-2100 Eastern Standard Time, on the third Wednesday of every month. Other scheduled downtime may occur as needed, and users will be made aware of this time in the System Maintenance window on the My GuardU tab. <br>
                <br>
                <b><u>Certificates:</u></b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. How do I print my certificate?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>A.&nbsp; </strong>Click on the "Certificate" link in the course. There is a link in the certificate section box that should be clicked as soon as you finish all the course requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit for the course&nbsp;won’t be recorded until this link is clicked.&nbsp; If the course has a time limit, the course and the certificate link will be removed at some point.&nbsp; <br>
                Once the link is clicked the certificate will open in a new window. Utilize your browser's print functions to print.&nbsp; Please ensure you set your printer to landscape. You may also save the certificate to your local computer for printing later.&nbsp; All files will save as an Adobe PDF.<br>
                If the link has been clicked, a copy of the certificate will remain on the (My GuardU tab page) in the “My GuardU Certificates” section box.&nbsp; This box is located under the “My Courses” section box.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. I do not see a link to my course completion certificate.</b><br>
                <br>
                A. The majority of courses require the following three items be completed prior to the certificate link being made available: 1) the student must complete all portions of the course, 2) the student must pass the course exam and 3) the student must complete a survey. When these three items are completed the certificate link will be made available. If the certificate link is not visible, the class folder may need to be refreshed. To ensure you return to the same page, do not use the browser refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp; To refresh the screen, click onto the Course POC link in a box located in the upper left corner of the Class Folder page.&nbsp; Then click back on the Class Folder link.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Q. I lost my certificate, how do I get a copy? </b><br>
                <br>
                A. There is a section on the My GuardU tab called My GuardU Certificates, which provides links to all the certificates the user has received. Also, if the course is still active on GuardU, users may simply go to that course, and click the certificate link at the bottom of the Class Folder.<br>
                <br>
                <b><u>Known Issues:</u></b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. Why am I having problems with interactive course content?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Many of the interactive courses were written to be run on Internet Explorer version 8 or higher. Because of this, the user will experience various problems when trying to view the course content on a lower version of Internet Explorer. If you are running Internet Explorer version 7 or lower, you should upgrade to version 8 or higher.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other reason why the content might not play.&nbsp; Click on the Known Issues link on the Portal page and review the Browser Issues section.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. Why am I having problems accessing courses with my Mac?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. Many of the interactive courses were written to be run on a PC. Because of this, the user will experience various problems when trying to view the course when using a Mac product, even if the product has a Windows operating system loaded on it.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Please see the <b>Known Issues</b> link located on both the Login and Portal pages for more information about all known issues.</i><br>
                <br>
                <b><u>Help:</u></b><br>
                <br>
                <b>Q. I forgot my password. Now what do I do?</b><br>
                <br>
                A. GuardU is AKO authenticated. If you cannot remember your AKO credentials, you must reset your password via AKO. To reset your password, go to the AKO home page and click Reset Password: https://www.us.army.mil.<br>
